# DCschoolMap
This data visualization tool is part of a larger [historical analysis project](http://forgenerationstocome.org/#/intro) for the [21st Century School Fund](http://www.21csf.org/csf-home/) and DC Public School system.  Interactive filters allow the user to select past, present and future spending data for schools of varying type and level:


	public vs charter

	elementary, middle and high schools

	total dollar expenditures, by school size (square feet/student population)


The version presented [here](http://tombeach.org/DCschoolMap/) contains updated styling and improved functionality. It is currently being modified for additional styling improvements and slight refactoring.
